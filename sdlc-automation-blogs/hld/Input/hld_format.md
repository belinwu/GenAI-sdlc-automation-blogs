Note: Use Mermaid for diagrams. Ensure no syntax issue

1. Overview <Purpose>
2. System Context
    - 2.1 Diagram with Explanation<Draw the diagram based on scope of the application or software and Architecture Decisions>
3. Application Architecture
    - 3.1 Diagram and Explanation <Include each microservices of application or software. Also, comply with Architecture Decisions>
    - 3.2 List of Microservices
        - 3.2.1..n. For each module or service,
            - Name
            - Short Description  
            - Detailed Functionaly of microservices
            - list of components <Frontend components, backend or API components, middleware components,  databases, etc>
4. Data Architecture
    - 4.1 Logical Data Model with Explanation <Define LDM diagram based on functionality and based on application Architecture.  Also, comply with Architecture Decisions>
    - 4.2 Data flow diagram with Explanation<Depicts how data captured, processed, stored, fetched.>

7. Deployment Architecture
    - 7.1 Diagram and Explanation<depicts deployment view/model of each microservice. use archimate notation/syntax. use mermaid tool. \
     Also, comply with Architecture Decisions and technology stack>

8. Architecture Decisions <Document decisions based on user confirmation and SRS.  \
    Note: AD requires to choose technology, design, db engine, cloud choice, etc. >
    - For each ADs,
        - context, 
        - alternatives, 
        - decisions,  
        - consequences.
