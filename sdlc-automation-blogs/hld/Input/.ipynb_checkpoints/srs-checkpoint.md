# Updated Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Task Management System

## 1. Introduction
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlines the requirements for a web-based task management system designed to enhance operational efficiency, improve performance, and ensure the reliability of task tracking for users. The system will cater to the needs of workers and managers, providing them with tools to manage tasks effectively.

The target audience includes both individual contributors (workers) who need to manage their own tasks and team leaders (managers) who require oversight of team performance and task allocation. The intended impact of this system is to streamline task management processes, reduce time spent on administrative tasks, and improve overall productivity within teams.

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements for the task management system. It aims to provide a clear understanding of the system's capabilities, ensuring that all stakeholders have a common understanding of the project objectives.

### 1.2 Scope
The task management system will include the following features and functionalities:
- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Set deadlines and reminders
- Categorize tasks
- Assign tasks to team members
- Track progress
- Share tasks with others
- Comment or add notes to tasks
- View tasks in different formats
- Search and filter tasks

**Exclusions**: The project will not include features for time tracking or billing, nor will it support integration with project management tools outside of the specified third-party APIs. The specific third-party APIs to be integrated will be detailed in the software interfaces section.

**Assumptions**: Users are assumed to have basic computer skills and internet access.

**Limitations**: The system will not support offline access, and it will not provide advanced reporting features beyond basic task tracking.

## 2. System Overview
The task management system is a web-based tool designed to facilitate task organization and collaboration among team members. It will provide a user-friendly interface for managing tasks, improving overall productivity.

### 2.1 Personas
The primary user personas for the system are:
- **Workers**: Require a straightforward interface to manage their tasks, set reminders, and track progress.
- **Managers**: Need tools to assign tasks, monitor team performance, and ensure deadlines are met.

### 2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Users are assumed to have basic computer skills and internet access.
- The system will depend on reliable internet connectivity and may integrate with third-party tools for enhanced functionality.
- Potential risks include changes in third-party API availability and user resistance to adopting new technology, which could impact project success. The identified risks may affect the project timeline and deliverables.

### 2.3 System Constraints
The system may face limitations such as:
- Dependency on third-party APIs for certain functionalities, which may introduce risks if those APIs change or become unavailable.
- User resistance to adopting new technology, which could affect the overall success of the implementation.

  3. User changes task status (e.g., in progress, completed).
  4. User submits the changes.

#### 3.2.2 Functionalities:
- Users can modify task details.
- Users can change task status (e.g., in progress, completed).

### 3.3 Feature: Task Deletion
#### 3.3.1 Use Case: Delete Task
- **Actors**: Workers, Managers
- **Preconditions**: User has access to the task they wish to delete.
- **Postconditions**: The task is removed from the system.
- **Steps**:
  1. User navigates to the task they wish to delete.
  2. User confirms the deletion action.
  3. The task is permanently removed from the system.

#### 3.3.2 Functionalities:
- Users can delete tasks permanently.

### 3.4 Feature: Task Tracking
#### 3.4.1 Use Case: Track Task Progress
- **Actors**: Workers, Managers
- **Preconditions**: User has tasks assigned to them or their team.
- **Postconditions**: User can view the status of tasks.
- **Steps**:
  1. User navigates to the task tracking page.
  2. User views tasks in different formats (list, calendar).
  3. User filters tasks based on status, category, or assignee.

#### 3.4.2 Functionalities:
- Users can view tasks in different formats (list, calendar).
- Users can filter tasks based on status, category, or assignee.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
### 4.1 Performance
