DesignReview = Enhance

- **Alignment with SRS**: The HLD generally aligns with the SRS, but there are areas where further detail is needed to ensure complete compliance with all functional requirements.
- **Microservices Clarity**: While microservices are defined, the interactions and data flow between them could be more explicitly detailed to ensure clarity on how they communicate and share data.
- **Error Handling**: The error handling mechanisms in the API specifications should be expanded to include specific scenarios and examples of error responses for better understanding.
- **Performance Metrics**: While performance metrics are mentioned, specific thresholds for response times and load testing strategies should be clearly defined to meet non-functional requirements.
- **Security Measures**: The security measures section could benefit from more detail on how multi-factor authentication will be implemented and the specific encryption methods used for data at rest and in transit.
- **Documentation Maintenance**: The documentation strategy should include a process for regular updates and reviews to ensure it remains current throughout the development lifecycle.
- **Integration with Third-Party APIs**: More detail is needed on how the system will handle failures or changes in third-party APIs, including fallback mechanisms and monitoring strategies.
