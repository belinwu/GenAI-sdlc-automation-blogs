DesignReview = Enhance

- **Alignment with SRS**: The HLD generally aligns with the SRS, but there are areas where further detail is needed to ensure complete compliance with all functional requirements.
- **Microservices Clarity**: While the microservices are defined, the interactions and data flow between them could be elaborated further to clarify dependencies and data exchange.
- **Error Handling**: The error handling section in the API specifications is a good start, but it should include more specific scenarios and examples for better clarity.
- **Performance Metrics**: While performance metrics are mentioned, specific thresholds for response times and load testing strategies should be explicitly defined to ensure they meet the non-functional requirements.
- **Security Measures**: The security measures are outlined, but additional details on how multi-factor authentication will be implemented and managed would enhance the design.
- **Documentation Maintenance**: The commitment to keeping API documentation up-to-date is noted, but a process for regular reviews and updates should be established to ensure ongoing accuracy.
