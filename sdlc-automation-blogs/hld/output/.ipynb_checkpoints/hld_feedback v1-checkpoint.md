DesignReview = Enhance

- **Alignment with SRS**: 
  - Ensure that all functional requirements from the SRS are explicitly addressed in the HLD. Some functionalities like "search and filter tasks" are not detailed in the HLD.
  
- **Architecture Compliance**: 
  - The choice of SQLite as a database may not scale well with the expected user load (1000 concurrent users). Consider using a more robust database solution like PostgreSQL for better performance and scalability.
  
- **Design Patterns**: 
  - The HLD mentions a microservices architecture, but it lacks details on how inter-service communication will handle failures or retries. Consider implementing circuit breaker patterns or service mesh for better resilience.
  
- **Security Considerations**: 
  - While the HLD mentions an authentication service, it should also detail how user data will be encrypted and how security audits will be conducted, as stated in the SRS.
  
- **Monitoring and Logging**: 
  - The monitoring service is mentioned, but there are no details on what metrics will be monitored or how logging will be handled across services. This is crucial for maintaining system reliability.
  
- **API Specification**: 
  - The API specifications should include response formats and error handling mechanisms to ensure consistency and clarity for frontend developers.
  
- **Deployment Considerations**: 
  - The deployment architecture should address how updates to microservices will be managed without downtime (e.g., blue-green deployments or canary releases).
