DesignReview = Enhance

- **Alignment with SRS**: The HLD generally aligns with the SRS, but it lacks explicit mention of how certain non-functional requirements (NFRs) such as usability metrics and compliance with GDPR will be implemented in the architecture.
  
- **Architecture Compliance**: The architecture uses microservices, which is a good design pattern; however, the document should clarify how inter-service communication will handle failures and retries beyond the Circuit Breaker pattern mentioned for the Notification Service.

- **Design Patterns**: While the use of REST APIs is appropriate, consider including more design patterns such as Repository or Service Layer patterns for better separation of concerns, especially in the Task and User Services.

- **Data Flow Clarity**: The data flow diagrams are helpful, but they should include more detail on how data validation and error handling will be managed across services.

- **Security Measures**: The security measures mentioned are good, but the HLD should elaborate on how multi-factor authentication will be implemented and what specific encryption methods will be used for data at rest.

- **Performance Metrics**: While performance metrics are mentioned, the HLD should specify how these metrics will be monitored and reported in real-time.

- **API Specification Completeness**: The API specifications are a good start, but they should include more detailed error handling scenarios and examples for each endpoint to enhance clarity for developers.

- **Deployment Architecture**: The deployment architecture diagram should include details on load balancing and failover strategies to ensure high availability.

- **Documentation**: The HLD mentions keeping API documentation up-to-date, but it should also include a strategy for maintaining user documentation and training materials for end-users.
