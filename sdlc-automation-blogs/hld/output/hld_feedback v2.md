DesignReview = Enhance

- **Alignment with SRS**: The HLD generally aligns with the SRS, but there are areas that require further clarification and detail.
- **Microservices Description**: The descriptions of the microservices lack specific details on how they handle errors and exceptions. Consider adding this information to ensure robustness.
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: The DFDs should include more detail on data transformations and validations that occur within the Task Management System.
- **Security Measures**: While JWT is mentioned, there is no mention of how user roles and permissions will be managed within the system. This is critical for task assignment and management.
- **Performance Metrics**: The HLD should specify performance metrics for each microservice, not just the overall system performance.
- **Integration with Third-Party APIs**: More detail is needed on how the system will handle failures or changes in third-party APIs, including fallback mechanisms.
- **Deployment Architecture**: The deployment architecture should include considerations for scaling the services independently based on load.
- **Compliance and Legal Requirements**: The HLD should explicitly mention how compliance with GDPR will be implemented in the architecture, especially concerning data storage and user consent.
