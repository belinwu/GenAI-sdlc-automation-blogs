DesignReview = Enhance

- **Alignment with SRS**: The HLD generally aligns with the SRS, but there are areas where further detail is needed to ensure complete compliance with all functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Architecture & Design Patterns**: 
  - The use of microservices is appropriate; however, the HLD should explicitly mention the design patterns used (e.g., Circuit Breaker, Repository Pattern) for clarity.
  - Consider including a section on how the system will handle scalability beyond the stated 1000 concurrent users.
- **Error Handling**: While error handling is mentioned, it should be more comprehensive, detailing specific scenarios and fallback mechanisms for each service.
- **Security Measures**: The HLD mentions encryption and multi-factor authentication, but it should also address how user data will be protected during API interactions and any compliance measures for GDPR.
- **Performance Metrics**: The performance metrics section should include specific thresholds for response times and load testing strategies to ensure the system meets the non-functional requirements.
- **API Specification Completeness**: Ensure that the API documentation includes examples of request and response payloads for better clarity for developers.
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: The DFDs should include more detail on data validation processes and how they interact with the services.
- **Deployment Architecture**: Consider adding details on failover strategies and load balancing mechanisms to ensure high availability.
