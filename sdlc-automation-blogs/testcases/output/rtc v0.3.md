### Revised Test Cases for Regression Testing

Based on the provided Software Requirements Specification (SRS), High-Level Design (HLD), and the additional information from the Test Lead, I have revised the regression test cases to ensure they align more closely with the requirements and design specifications. The revisions address the identified mismatches and incorporate additional functionalities as necessary.

    1. Navigate to the task creation page.
    2. Enter a valid title for the task.
    3. Leave the description, due date, priority, and tags fields empty.
    4. Click the "Create Task" button.
- **Test Data**: Title: "Test Task"
- **Expected Result**: The task is created successfully, and the user is redirected to the task list page with a success message.
- **Remarks**: Ensure that the task appears in the task list.

### Test Case 2
- **Test Case ID**: TC_TM_02
- **Title**: Verify Task Assignment to a User
- **Description**: Ensure that a user can assign a task to another user.
- **Preconditions**: User must be logged into the application and have at least one task created.
- **Test Steps**:
    1. Navigate to the task list page.
    2. Select a task to assign.
    3. Click on the "Assign" button.
    4. Choose a user from the dropdown list.
    5. Click the "Confirm" button.
- **Test Data**: Task: "Test Task"; Assignee: "User A"
- **Expected Result**: The task is assigned to the selected user, and a notification is sent to the assignee.
- **Remarks**: Verify that the assignee can see the task in their task list.

### Test Case 3
- **Test Case ID**: TC_TM_03
- **Title**: Verify Task Status Update
- **Description**: Ensure that a user can update the status of a task, including additional statuses.
- **Preconditions**: User must be logged into the application and have a task assigned to them.
- **Test Steps**:
    1. Navigate to the task list page.
    2. Select a task that is currently "Open".
    3. Click on the "Change Status" button.
    4. Select "In Progress" from the status options.
    5. Click the "Update" button.
- **Test Data**: Task: "Test Task"; New Status: "In Progress"
- **Expected Result**: The task status is updated to "In Progress", and a notification is sent to relevant users.
- **Remarks**: Ensure that the status change is reflected in the task list.

### Test Case 4
- **Test Case ID**: TC_TM_04
- **Title**: Verify Task Status Update with Additional Statuses
- **Description**: Ensure that a user can update the status of a task to Blocked and Archived.
- **Preconditions**: User must be logged into the application and have a task assigned to them.
- **Test Steps**:
    1. Navigate to the task list page.
    2. Select a task that is currently "Open".
    3. Click on the "Change Status" button.
    4. Select "Blocked" from the status options.
    5. Click the "Update" button.
    6. Repeat steps 3-5 for "Archived".
- **Test Data**: Task: "Test Task"; New Statuses: "Blocked", "Archived"
- **Expected Result**: The task status is updated to "Blocked" and then to "Archived", with notifications sent for each change.
- **Remarks**: Ensure that both status changes are reflected in the task list.

### Test Case 5
- **Test Case ID**: TC_NT_01
- **Title**: Verify Notification for Task Assignment
- **Description**: Ensure that the assigned user receives a notification when a task is assigned to them.
- **Preconditions**: User A must be logged in and assigned a task by User B.
- **Test Steps**:
    1. User B assigns a task to User A.
    2. Check the notifications for User A.
- **Test Data**: Task: "Test Task"; Assignee: "User A"
- **Expected Result**: User A receives an in-app notification and an email notification regarding the task assignment.
- **Remarks**: Verify the content of the notification.

### Test Case 6
- **Test Case ID**: TC_RP_01
- **Title**: Verify Report Generation for Overdue Tasks
- **Description**: Ensure that the user can generate a report for overdue tasks.
- **Preconditions**: User must be logged into the application and have overdue tasks.
- **Test Steps**:
    1. Navigate to the reporting section.
    2. Select the option to generate a report for overdue tasks.
    3. Click the "Generate Report" button.
- **Test Data**: N/A
- **Expected Result**: A report is generated listing all overdue tasks.
- **Remarks**: Ensure the report is downloadable in a suitable format (e.g., PDF, CSV).

### Self-Critique
- The revised test cases now include additional statuses for tasks, as specified in the SRS, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the task management functionalities.
- Each test case has been structured to align with the requirements outlined in the SRS and the design in the HLD, ensuring that all critical functionalities are tested.
- I will continue to review these test cases against any further feedback from the Test Lead to ensure they meet the required standards and incorporate any necessary adjustments.

Please provide any additional feedback or requirements for further refinement of these test cases.
